Pinball Roguelike

Wannabe free time side project. When it is ready, it will be published on steam for something very cheap.

I have no hopes with this project, but I do it for fun.

If you feel like contributing with anything, message me on my discord: dalacul

Please do not steal my idea, or else I'll cry in a corner.
